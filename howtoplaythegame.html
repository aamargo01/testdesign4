   <p>Icing;  Hockey icing was created in 1937 as a way to eliminate delay tactics. Prior to the rule being introduced, teams that had a lead on their opposition late in games could simply shoot the puck all the way down the ice without the play stopping, thus wasting time on the clock.</p>

   <p>Offside: A team is offside when any member of the attacking team precedes the puck over the defending team's blueline. The position of the player's skate — and not that of his stick — is the determining factor. If both skates are over the blueline before the puck, the player is offside.</p>

Penalties are also given for stick fouls like slashing, spearing, hooking, holding, tripping, cross-checking and high-sticking.</p>
